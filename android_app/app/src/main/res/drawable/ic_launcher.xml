<!-- This is a placeholder for the app icon. 
     For a production build, you would need to:
     1. Copy logo/Logo.png to this drawable directory as ic_launcher.png
     2. Or create proper adaptive icons with different densities
     
     For now, this references the logo in the project root.
     To complete the icon setup, run:
     cp ../../../../../../logo/Logo.png ic_launcher.png
